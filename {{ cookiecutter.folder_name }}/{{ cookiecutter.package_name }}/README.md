# ✨ Time to Get Your Hands Dirty! ✨

Ah, brave coder! You have ventured into the land of data ingestion, 
preprocessing, training and other parts of your ML pipeline. 

Your quest? To transform chaos into order (a.k.a. refactor everything from 
your Jupyter Notebooks into production-ready code). 🏗️

## 🛠️ What do you need to do?

- Take your logic and refactor it into production code within the src/ directory.

- Modify all files starting with `change_me_*`

- If you requested example files (`example_*`), use them as inspiration for your 
refactoring.

## 🚀 Go forth and code!
