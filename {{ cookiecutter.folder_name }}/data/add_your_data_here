Please delete me, I am just a placeholder for your actual data.
If you have the data stored locally on your system, you can move it here so that the MLOps framework has access to it.
If you are pulling it via S3 AWS, you can either store it here or use MinIO backend.
You can also store the intermediate and final data after your preprocessing and feature engineering.
